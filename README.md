# ConvexHullVisualizer
A simple program in C++ that allows users to see the difference between a brute-force algorithm and the Quick-Hull algorithm for finding the convex hull of a set of points.

*make test* will run with no visual output.

*make n* will run with *n* points and produce a visual output. n = 10, 50, 100, or 1000.
